# Parser Dialect Compatibility Design

## Problem

SafeRE aims to be a drop-in replacement for `java.util.regex.Pattern`, while
using a parser lineage that came from RE2.  That creates a recurring risk:
source syntax can be parsed according to the wrong dialect before any matching
engine runs.

This matters because parser mistakes are silent semantic bugs.  A pattern can
compile successfully, but mean something different from the JDK.  Users then
observe wrong matches even though the matching engines are behaving correctly
for the AST they were given.

Recent bugs show the class:

- #216: POSIX bracket spellings such as `[[:lower:]]` were interpreted with
  RE2/POSIX semantics instead of JDK character-class text semantics.
- #217: `(?P<name>...)` was accepted even though the JDK named-capture spelling
  is `(?<name>...)`.
- #220: empty left-side character-class intersections such as `[&&abc]` and
  `[a&&&&b]` diverged from the JDK.
- #224: octal escape acceptance and interpretation drifted from
  `java.util.regex`.

The common problem is not any one syntax feature.  It is the absence of an
explicit dialect policy that every parser feature must pass through.

This design does not claim that SafeRE can prove complete equivalence with the
JDK parser.  The JDK parser is not exposed as a formal grammar or structured
oracle, and some edge behavior is only observable by compiling and matching
examples.  The achievable contract is an engineering one: every known syntax
family has an explicit policy, and that policy is backed by compile/error and
membership tests against `java.util.regex`.

## Design Principle

SafeRE should not have regex syntax extensions in `Pattern.compile`.

SafeRE-only public APIs such as `PatternSet` are fine.  The default target for
the regex language accepted by `Pattern.compile` is JDK compatibility.  Each
syntax feature should follow one of two policies:

- **JDK-compatible:** SafeRE accepts the syntax and gives it the same
  membership, capture, flag, and compile/reject behavior as `java.util.regex`,
  subject to documented linear-time rejections and documented explicit
  exceptions for unspecified JDK edge behavior.
- **Rejected:** SafeRE rejects the syntax because the JDK rejects it, or because
  supporting it would violate SafeRE's linear-time guarantee.

There should not be a third implicit category of "accepted because RE2 accepts
it" or "accepted because it was easy to parse."  RE2 source compatibility is a
source of implementation ideas, not a product dialect.  A documented divergence
is an explicit exception to these policies, not a separate parser dialect: it
must name the public behavior, explain why JDK compatibility is not the chosen
contract, and include regression coverage.

For behavior that is unspecified by the JDK documentation but observable in
`java.util.regex.Pattern`, the default is still to follow the running JDK oracle
for drop-in compatibility.  Falling back to an unspecified-behavior argument is
an escape hatch, not an equal goal: use it only when exact compatibility would
break SafeRE's linear-time guarantee, make the parser materially brittle or
unmaintainable, or depend on version-sensitive behavior that is not part of the
documented Java regex grammar.

## Current State

SafeRE already has significant JDK syntax coverage:

- `JdkSyntaxCompatibilityTest` is organized around JDK `Pattern` syntax
  families.
- Generated public API crosscheck exercises many compiled patterns through
  both SafeRE and the JDK.
- Unicode property tests compare SafeRE's property spellings and membership
  against the running JDK.
- Unsupported non-regular features such as backreferences and lookaround are
  rejected rather than emulated.
- Recent bugs in this design's scope are covered by focused regression work.

The remaining weak point is that not every parser syntax family has the same
explicit coverage shape.  The character-class expression parser now has a
generated JDK-oracle matrix, but other syntax families still rely more heavily
on focused examples and parser branches.  Future parser work should move each
family toward the same policy: name the dialect category, add executable
compile/error and membership coverage, and keep any intentional divergence
documented.

## Dialect Policy

The parser should classify every syntax feature into one explicit policy
category.  A documented explicit exception is recorded separately when SafeRE
intentionally diverges from JDK behavior under the rules above.

| Category | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accepted JDK syntax | JDK accepts the spelling and SafeRE implements the same syntax and semantics. | literals, character classes, quantifiers, `(?<name>...)`, `\p{Lu}`, `\Q...\E`, `\R`, `\X`, JDK flags |
| JDK-compatible with linear implementation | JDK accepts the spelling, and SafeRE implements the same observable behavior with a linear engine rather than backtracking. | alternation priority, captures in supported regular syntax, anchors, regions |
| Rejected non-regular JDK syntax | JDK accepts the spelling, but supporting it would violate SafeRE's linear-time guarantee or architecture. | backreferences, lookahead, lookbehind, possessive quantifiers |
| Rejected non-JDK syntax | Another regex dialect accepts the spelling, but JDK does not. | `(?P<name>...)`, RE2/Python-only or POSIX-only spellings |
| JDK accepted literal text | A spelling resembles another dialect's metasyntax but is ordinary text in the JDK. | POSIX bracket fragments inside Java character classes such as `[[:lower:]]` |
| JDK rejected malformed syntax | Both JDK and SafeRE should throw `PatternSyntaxException`. | malformed octal escapes such as `\0`, bad property names, invalid group syntax |
| Documented explicit exception | SafeRE intentionally differs from JDK behavior for a stated reason and has regression coverage. This is not a dialect category; it is an exception that must be reviewed and documented. | unspecified character-class edge behavior where exact JDK compatibility would break linear time or make the parser materially brittle |

The implementation does not need a giant runtime table.  The design target is a
source-level matrix near parser tests, plus helper APIs that make every family
testable against the JDK oracle.

The matrix is not a one-time proof that no undiscovered parser divergence
exists.  It is the place where future parser divergences must be classified.
When a new dialect bug appears, the fix should add or refine a matrix row and
its tests, rather than introducing local parser behavior without naming the
syntax policy.

## Compatibility Matrix

The focused compatibility matrix should cover at least these syntax families.

| Family | Policy | Oracle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Literal characters and quoting | JDK-compatible | compile and membership tests, including `LITERAL` flag and `\Q...\E` |
| Escaped literals and control escapes | JDK-compatible or JDK-rejected | compile/error tests and representative membership |
| Octal, numeric, hex, Unicode, and named-character escapes | JDK-compatible for accepted forms; reject JDK-rejected forms | compile/error tests plus membership for boundary values |
| Predefined character classes | JDK-compatible | membership against representative ASCII, Unicode, and line-terminator inputs |
| Java character classes | JDK-compatible | membership against `java.lang.Character` behavior |
| POSIX property escapes `\p{Lower}` etc. | JDK-compatible | membership against JDK |
| POSIX bracket fragments `[[:lower:]]` | ordinary JDK character-class text, not POSIX metasyntax | membership tests proving characters like `l`, `o`, `w`, `e`, `r`, `:`, `[`, and `]` behave like JDK |
| Unicode scripts, blocks, categories, and binary properties | JDK-compatible, tied to the running JDK where possible | property lookup and membership crosschecks |
| Character-class union, range, intersection, subtraction, and negation | JDK-compatible for documented grammar; unspecified observable edge behavior follows the character-class policy below | generated membership tests for edge shapes, including zero-width class syntax, empty RHS expressions, and malformed range endpoints |
| Group syntax | JDK-compatible accepted forms; reject non-JDK forms | compile/error tests for capturing, non-capturing, flags, named groups, and rejected dialect spellings |
| Quantifier syntax | JDK-compatible where regular; reject unsupported non-regular forms | compile/error tests plus membership for greedy/lazy and bounded forms |
| Boundary matchers and line terminators | JDK-compatible where supported | membership and `hitEnd`/`requireEnd` tests where observable |
| Comments and embedded flags | JDK-compatible | compile and membership tests for whitespace, comments, scoped flags, and flag restoration |
| Unsupported non-regular constructs | rejected with clear errors | compile-error tests against known feature spellings |

This matrix should live in the focused test suite or a small package-private
test helper rather than only in prose.  The doc should describe the policy; the
tests should make the policy executable.

## Parser Architecture

The top-level regex parser should retain its stack-based shape.  This design is
not a request to replace or delegate the whole parser.  It does allow replacing
or substantially refactoring the character-class subparser when that is the
principled way to model JDK character-class expression precedence.

### Character-Class Terminology

This design uses these character-class terms consistently:

- **Trivia**: whitespace and comments skipped by `COMMENTS` mode.  Trivia never
  consumes first-item state and never contributes characters to the class.
- **Zero-width class syntax**: source syntax that consumes characters from the
  pattern but contributes no class item, such as an empty quoted literal
  sequence (`\Q\E`).  Zero-width class syntax does not consume first-item state.
- **Class item**: one source-level item in a character class that can contribute
  characters or a nested class expression to the current class.  Examples
  include literal characters, escaped characters, predefined classes, Unicode
  property classes, POSIX bracket spellings when JDK-compatible, and nested
  character classes.
- **First item**: the first class item after the opening `[` or `[^`, ignoring
  trivia and operator tokens that do not contribute a class item.  First-item
  state controls JDK edge syntax such as leading `-` and leading `]`.
- **Range endpoint**: a scalar character endpoint on either side of a range
  operator (`-`).  A range endpoint is narrower than a class item: a nested
  class opener (`[`) may begin a class item, but it is not a valid unescaped
  range endpoint.
- **Operator token**: syntax that combines class operands, such as range (`-`)
  and intersection (`&&`).  Operator validation belongs to character-class
  expression parsing, not to later AST repair.  An operator token contributes no
  characters by itself and does not consume first-item state.
- **Class piece**: a source-level unit inside a character class after
  zero-width syntax and comments-mode trivia normalization.  A class piece can
  be a scalar/range item, quoted literal item, predefined/property operand,
  nested class, raw ampersand run, or class terminator.
- **Operand-like piece**: a piece that behaves as a complete expression operand
  for intersection state: ranges, non-inline scalars, predefined classes,
  property classes, and nested classes.  Ordinary inline scalar text is not
  operand-like until a transition incorporates it.
- **Accumulated expression**: the union/intersection expression built so far for
  the current bracketed frame.
- **Current operand**: the most recent operand-like expression that can be the
  left side of an intersection decision.  It can differ from the accumulated
  expression.
- **Pending scalar run**: ordinary scalar or quoted-literal content that has
  contributed characters but whose intersection role is still undecided.
- **Raw ampersand separator**: an unescaped raw source `&` that has contributed
  literal `&` and is separated from a following raw ampersand run only by
  zero-width quoted syntax or comments-mode trivia.
- **Normalized operator tail**: the source position after a raw ampersand run
  and after repeatedly skipping zero-width quoted syntax plus comments-mode
  trivia, together with whether zero-width syntax or comments-mode trivia was
  skipped.
- **RHS**: the unbracketed right-hand expression started by a raw `&&`
  intersection operator.
- **RHS terminator**: `]` or raw `&` that stops an unbracketed RHS before it
  has consumed a new bracketed expression.  A terminator is syntax, not
  automatically a literal class item.
- **Synthetic empty expression**: a JDK-observed accepted transition whose
  membership is empty and whose outer negation is suppressed.  This is not
  ordinary set complement of an empty class.

### Character-Class Parser Contract

The character-class parser should satisfy this contract:

- The parser consumes source text as a sequence of trivia, class items,
  operator tokens, and zero-width class syntax.
- Trivia is skipped before deciding whether the next source token is a class
  item, range endpoint, operator token, or class terminator.
- Trivia and zero-width class syntax must be normalized to a fixed point before
  token classification, because either can expose the other.  For example, in
  `COMMENTS` mode, `\Q\E` followed by whitespace before an operator is still
  zero-width syntax plus trivia, not a literal whitespace class item.
- Operator tokens do not contribute characters and do not consume first-item
  state unless the JDK grammar treats the surrounding syntax as a literal class
  item.
- Zero-width class syntax does not contribute characters and does not consume
  first-item state.
- Only class items consume first-item state.
- Leading intersection syntax must be parsed according to the JDK
  character-class expression grammar.  If an initial `&&` is interpreted as an
  intersection operator, it must not consume first-item state for the following
  class item; malformed leading forms such as `&&]`, `&&&&`, or `&&&` must be
  rejected only when the JDK rejects them.
- A leading literal `-` is a class item when it appears in first-item position
  or before the class terminator.
- A `-` is a range operator only when it appears between two valid range
  endpoints.  Immediate class termination after `-`, including after immediate
  zero-width quoted syntax, keeps `-` literal; comments-mode trivia after `-`
  follows JDK behavior and does not by itself make the `-` trailing literal.
- A range endpoint must be a scalar character or escaped scalar character.  A
  nested class opener may begin a class item, but it is not a scalar endpoint.
  When a `-` is immediately followed by a valid nested class item, the `-`
  remains a literal class item and the nested class is parsed as the next class
  item.  Malformed or unclosed nested class syntax after `-` is rejected when
  the nested class item is parsed.  In `COMMENTS` mode, trivia after `-` follows
  the JDK range-disambiguation behavior described above rather than making the
  following nested class immediate.
- Nested character classes are parsed as class items.  They are not repaired
  after being consumed as malformed range endpoints.
- Every accepted character-class spelling must either match JDK membership or
  be rejected earlier as an unsupported non-regular construct.  Every
  JDK-rejected malformed spelling in this contract must throw
  `PatternSyntaxException`.

### Character-Class Expression Parser Contract

The token contract above is the foundation for JDK-compatible character-class
parsing: trivia, zero-width syntax, operator tokens, first-item state, scalar
range endpoints, and nested class items must be classified consistently.
[Issue #273](https://github.com/eaftan/safere/issues/273) builds on that
foundation with an explicit expression parser, or an equivalent state machine,
for JDK character-class operator precedence and the edge behavior that is only
observable through the JDK oracle.

The JDK `Pattern` documentation also defines character-class operators and
their precedence:

1. literal escape;
2. grouping (`[...]`);
3. range (`a-z`);
4. union;
5. intersection (`&&`).

Some accepted but unusual JDK spellings, such as repeated, trailing, or
ambiguous `&&` around nested classes and predefined classes, depend on that
full expression model.  Examples include forms like `[a&&&&a]`, `[[a]&&]`,
and `[\d&&]`.  SafeRE handles those with the character-class expression parser,
or an equivalent explicit state machine, that models grouping, range, union, and
intersection precedence directly instead of continuing to grow local `&&`
special cases.

The parser should treat literal characters, escaped scalar characters,
predefined character classes, Unicode and POSIX property classes, quoted literal
content, and nested `[...]` groups as character-class expression pieces in a
SafeRE-owned parser model.  Quoted literal content expands into literal class
items according to JDK behavior; it is not a magic scalar range endpoint.
Ranges may use only scalar range endpoints, while unions and intersections
combine class expressions according to JDK precedence.

The implementation must be independent of OpenJDK source code.  The JDK
Javadocs are the written syntax and precedence specification.  Where the
Javadocs do not fully determine edge behavior, such as trailing or repeated
`&&` mixed with nested classes, predefined classes, quoted literals, and
comments-mode trivia, SafeRE should define the behavior in its own parser-state
terms and verify it with black-box differential tests against
`java.util.regex.Pattern`.  Do not copy, transliterate, preserve private
OpenJDK parser structure, or use OpenJDK-internal names as implementation
guidance.

These edge spellings should be treated as unspecified by the JDK documentation
but observable in `java.util.regex.Pattern`.  SafeRE should follow the running
JDK oracle for drop-in compatibility by default.  If matching an unspecified JDK
edge behavior would break the linear-time guarantee, make the parser materially
brittle or unmaintainable, or depend on version-sensitive behavior outside the
documented Java regex grammar, the behavior should be classified explicitly:
prefer the documented JDK grammar, reject the pattern with
`PatternSyntaxException` if necessary, and document the divergence with
regression coverage rather than adding unprincipled compatibility patches.

The equivalent explicit state machine should follow this SafeRE-owned
operational contract:

1. Normalize before classification.  Repeatedly skip comments-mode trivia and
   zero-width class syntax until the source position stops moving.
2. Classify exactly one next token kind after normalization: class terminator,
   intersection operator, nested class start, predefined/property class item,
   quoted literal class item, or scalar/range class item.
3. Maintain separate state for the accumulated expression, the current operand,
   pending scalar run, raw ampersand context, normalized operator tail, and any
   RHS expression being parsed.
4. Keep pending scalar runs distinct from nested/predefined/property
   operands until an operator or terminator requires it to be incorporated.
   This distinction is observable for JDK-compatible trailing and repeated
   intersections, so the parser must not collapse all class items into a single
   generic "completed set" model.
5. Parse `&&` as the start of a RHS expression.  If that expression is
   empty before the next terminator or operator, apply the SafeRE-specified
   behavior that is covered by black-box JDK oracle tests for the corresponding
   syntax family.
6. Distinguish pending class piece roles that are observable through the JDK
   oracle.  This is not just a pending-scalar problem: raw `&`, quoted `&`,
   zero-width quoted syntax, comments-mode trivia, scalar runs, ranges,
   predefined classes, properties, and nested classes all affect whether a
   following `&&` starts an intersection, terminates an empty RHS,
   preserves a literal ampersand, or makes the class malformed.  The
   implementation must model these roles explicitly rather than relying on a
   single "ambiguous ampersand" state.
7. Apply negation only after the bracketed expression is complete.
8. Represent nested classes with explicit frames or another stack-safe
   mechanism; source nesting must not recurse on the Java call stack.

### Character-Class Expression Semantic Model

The expression parser should be described as a deterministic transition system,
not as a loose collection of parser flags.  The high-level rule is:

> A character class is parsed as source-level class pieces whose provenance is
> observable until an operator, terminator, or range decision has consumed that
> provenance.  The parser must not prematurely collapse source pieces into only
> character sets, because JDK behavior for intersections depends on whether a
> piece was raw syntax, quoted literal text, comments-mode trivia, a scalar run,
> a range/predefined/property operand, or a nested class.

This rule is the reason the parser needs a small expression state machine
instead of local `&&` special cases.  Character-class parsing has two layers:

- **Set algebra**: completed operand-like pieces are combined with union and
  intersection.
- **Source transition semantics**: raw `&`, quoted `&`, empty quoted syntax,
  comments-mode trivia, pending scalar text, and unbracketed RHS expressions
  decide which set operation is being performed and whether the spelling is
  malformed.

Each character-class frame owns this state:

- **Accumulated expression**: the class expression built so far.
- **Current operand**: the most recent operand-like expression.  This
  is not always the same as the accumulated expression; comments-mode repeated
  intersections can use the current operand while preserving or discarding
  other accumulated pieces according to the transition below.
- **Pending scalar run**: source-level scalar content that has contributed
  characters but has not yet been incorporated into intersection state.  This
  includes ordinary scalar text and quoted literal text that has not become an
  operand-like range or non-inline scalar.
- **Pending class piece role**: the observable role of the pending source-level
  class piece: ordinary scalar text, standalone scalar/range operand, raw
  ampersand separator, or completed nested/predefined/property operand.
- **Raw ampersand context**: whether a source-level `&` was parsed as raw
  syntax, whether a completed left expression exists before it, whether it has
  already contributed a literal `&`, and whether only zero-width syntax or
  comments-mode trivia separates it from a following operator or right-hand
  token.
- **Literal ampersand context**: whether `&` came from raw source text, an
  escaped literal such as `\&`, or quoted literal content such as `\Q&\E`.
  Escaped and quoted literal `&` are not the same token as raw source `&`; the
  JDK oracle distinguishes them in trailing and repeated intersection cases.
- **Normalized operator tail**: the count and parity of consecutive raw `&`
  syntax, plus whether zero-width quoted syntax or comments-mode trivia was
  skipped after the run.  `&&`, `&&&`, and longer runs are not equivalent, and
  they are still not equivalent after trivia has been skipped.
- **RHS expression**: the unbracketed right-hand expression being collected
  after `&&`.
- **Synthetic empty expression**: a JDK-observed transition for comments-mode
  repeated intersections whose right-hand tail is discarded.  This is not the
  same as parsing an ordinary empty class and then applying outer negation.

The pending class piece role is part of the semantics:

- **Ordinary scalar text**: inline scalar text after an existing class
  expression before an empty right-hand intersection is malformed.  Examples to
  test against the JDK oracle include `[[a]b&&]`, `[[a]a&&]`, and `[\d0&&]`.
- **Standalone scalar/range operand**: ranges and scalar items that the oracle
  treats as operands participate in the intersection.  Examples include
  `[[a]a-b&&]`, `[\d0-1&&]`, and non-inline scalar examples such as
  `[[a]\u0100&&]`.
- **Raw ampersand separator**: an unescaped raw source `&` after an established
  left expression, followed only by zero-width syntax or comments-mode trivia
  before a raw `&&` run, remains a literal class item but also participates in
  the repeated-intersection transition.  Examples include `[[a]&\Q\E&&]`,
  `(?x)[[a]& &&]`, `[\d&\Q\E&&]`, and `(?x)[\d& #x\n&&]`.
- **Raw ampersand without a left expression**: the same unescaped raw source `&`
  shape is malformed when there is no completed left expression before it.
  Examples include `[&\Q\E&&]`, `[&\Q\E&&a]`, and their repeated-operator
  variants.  The parser must not repair this by treating the `&` as an ordinary
  literal or by treating the following `&&` as an empty trailing intersection.
- **Escaped or quoted ampersand literal**: `\&` and `\Q&\E` contribute literal
  `&`; neither creates a raw ampersand separator.  They can be ordinary literal
  operands, participate in ordinary intersections, or make an otherwise
  trailing-looking spelling malformed depending on the left operand and the
  operator run.  Examples include `[\&\Q\E&&]`, `[\Q&\E&&]`,
  `[a\Q&\E&&b]`, `[[a]\Q&\E&&]`, and `[\d\Q&\E&&\D]`.

The state machine has these transition rules.

1. **Normalize before token classification.**  At every class-expression
   boundary, skip comments-mode trivia and zero-width quoted syntax until the
   source position stops moving.  The transition must remember whether this
   skipped zero-width syntax, comments-mode trivia, or both.  JDK behavior can
   distinguish immediately adjacent syntax from syntax separated by these
   normalized source forms.

2. **Classify exactly one token after normalization.**  The token kind is one
   of: class terminator, raw ampersand run, nested class start,
   predefined/property operand, quoted literal item, or scalar/range item.
   Token classification must retain source provenance.  In particular, raw
   source `&`, escaped literal `\&`, and quoted literal `&` are different token
   kinds even though they can contribute the same character to the final set.

3. **Preserve current operand separately from accumulated expression.**  A
   completed range, non-inline scalar, nested class, predefined class, or
   property class updates the current operand and is unioned into the
   accumulated expression.  Ordinary scalar text is pending until a later
   transition decides whether it should be incorporated, rejected, or used only
   as literal class content.  This distinction is observable in cases such as
   `[\d0&&]`, `[\d0-1&&]`, `(?x)[a0-1&&& 0]`, and
   `(?x)[a0-1&&& 0-1]`.

4. **Reject malformed pending scalar text after an operand.**  If an existing
   operand-like expression is followed by ordinary scalar text and then an
   empty or terminator-like RHS, the spelling is malformed.  A later raw
   ampersand, zero-width quote, or comments-mode trivia must not repair that
   left side.  This covers both trailing forms and
   comments-mode RHS tail forms such as `[[a]b&&]`, `[\d0&&]`,
   `(?x)[a-ba&& &]`, and `(?x)[a-ba&&& [b]]`.

5. **Treat raw ampersand separator as a transition, not as a scalar role.**
   An unescaped raw source `&` after an established left expression, followed
   only by zero-width quoted syntax or comments-mode trivia before a raw
   ampersand run, remains literal content but also participates in
   repeated-intersection syntax.  The transition carries these dimensions:

   - whether a completed left expression exists;
   - whether the left expression is pending scalar-only, a range/scalar operand,
     a nested class, a predefined/property class, or a union of such pieces;
   - whether separator text is zero-width quoted syntax, comments-mode trivia,
     or absent;
   - the raw `&` run length and parity after the separator;
   - whether the RHS is absent, a scalar, a range, a quoted literal, a nested
     class, a predefined/property class, or another raw/quoted ampersand.

   If no completed left expression exists, the same raw source shape is
   malformed.  A parser that folds raw `&` into pending scalar text before this
   decision cannot implement the JDK oracle.

6. **Keep escaped and quoted ampersands separate from raw ampersand.**  Escaped
   `\&` and quoted `\Q&\E` contribute literal content and do not create a raw
   ampersand separator.  They can still participate in ordinary class-item and
   intersection behavior, but they must not take the raw-ampersand transition.
   This provenance explains why similar-looking raw, escaped, and quoted
   spellings have different accept/reject and membership results.

7. **Interpret operator runs by both parity and tail shape.**  A raw `&&`
   starts a RHS expression.  Longer raw ampersand runs are interpreted
   by count, parity, and the normalized tail after the run:

   - Without comments-mode trivia after the run, odd repeated runs preserve the
     relevant left expression and contribute a literal `&`.
   - With comments-mode trivia after an odd run, scalar and quoted-scalar RHS
     forms use the accumulated left expression, while operand-like RHS forms
     such as ranges, non-inline scalars, predefined classes, properties, and
     nested classes can use the current operand.  This distinction is observable
     in `(?x)[a0-1&&& 0]` versus `(?x)[a0-1&&& 0-1]`.
   - A normalized tail that reaches a solitary raw `&` is not necessarily an
     empty RHS.  If there is a valid left expression, the solitary raw `&` may
     be consumed as a RHS terminator/tail marker and can contribute literal `&`
     according to the operator run.  If there is no valid left expression, the
     spelling is malformed.
   - A normalized tail that reaches a nested class after comments-mode trivia in
     the repeated-intersection edge family produces the JDK-observed synthetic
     empty expression and ignores the remaining nested tail until the matching
     class terminator.  This transition must not accidentally re-read the RHS
     terminator `&` as a literal or union the nested class back into the result.

8. **Make synthetic empty expression explicit.**  Some comments-mode repeated
   intersection tails produce an accepted expression with empty membership,
   even under a negated outer class.  This is not ordinary set negation of an
   empty class; it is a parser transition that suppresses the outer negation
   for that synthetic result.  Cases such as `(?x)[a&&& [b]]` and
   `(?x)[^a&&& [b]]` must both be covered.

9. **Declare every transition's effects.**  Each transition must state whether
   it consumes source, contributes literal characters, starts or finishes a
   RHS expression, updates the accumulated expression, updates the
   current operand, rejects the pattern, or creates a synthetic empty
   expression.  Any source character used as a RHS terminator must not be
   accidentally re-read as a literal unless
   that is an explicit transition backed by oracle tests.

The model must be checked against an oracle matrix.  The matrix must cover the
full product of these axes:

- positive and negated classes;
- ordinary and `COMMENTS` mode;
- left expression shape: no left expression, scalar-only, range, non-inline
  scalar, quoted scalar, nested class, predefined class, property class, and
  unions of those shapes;
- ampersand provenance: raw source `&`, escaped literal `\&`, and quoted
  literal `&`;
- separator shape: no separator, zero-width quoted syntax, comments-mode
  whitespace, comments-mode line comments, and mixtures of zero-width syntax
  and comments-mode trivia;
- normalization boundary: zero-width quoted syntax and comments-mode trivia
  absent or present before separator detection, after raw ampersand runs, before
  RHS classification, and before class terminators;
- operator run: `&&`, odd repeated runs such as `&&&`, and even repeated runs
  longer than `&&`;
- right-hand shape: absent, scalar, range, quoted literal, nested class,
  predefined class, property class, raw `&`, and quoted `&`.

Representative public-JDK results include:

| Syntax family | Examples | JDK-observed behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scalar-only trailing intersection | `[ab&&]`, `[a-b&&]`, `[ab&&&&]` | preserves the scalar/range class |
| Scalar-only odd repeated intersection | `[ab&&&]`, `[ab&&&c]` | preserves the scalar/range class and includes literal `&`, plus following scalar RHS where present |
| Nested/predefined trailing intersection | `[[a]&&]`, `[\d&&]` | preserves the nested/predefined operand |
| Nested/predefined odd repeated intersection | `[[a]&&&]`, `[\d&&&]` | preserves the operand and includes literal `&` |
| Ordinary scalar after existing expression | `[[a]b&&]`, `[[a]a&&]`, `[\d0&&]` | rejected as bad intersection syntax |
| Range or non-inline scalar after existing expression | `[[a]a-b&&]`, `[\d0-1&&]`, `[[a]\u0100&&]`, `[\d\u0100&&]` | the range or non-inline scalar participates as the intersection operand |
| Quoted ordinary scalar after existing expression | `[[a]\Qa\E&&]`, `[[a]\Q&\E&&]` | rejected as bad intersection syntax |
| Raw ampersand separator with no left expression | `[&\Q\E&&]`, `[&\Q\E&&a]`, `[&\Q\E&&&a]` | rejected as bad class syntax |
| Raw ampersand separator before trailing `&&` | `[[a]&\Q\E&&]`, `(?x)[[a]& &&]`, `[\d&\Q\E&&]`, `(?x)[\d& #x\n&&]` | preserves the preceding expression and literal `&` |
| Raw ampersand separator with repeated `&&` | `[\d&\Q\E&&&]`, `[\d&\Q\E&&&&]`, `(?x)[\w&\Q\E&& &&]` | follows repeated-intersection edge behavior; oracle tests must assert both literal `&` preservation and membership of the surrounding expression |
| Escaped/quoted ampersand with no left expression | `[\&\Q\E&&]`, `[\Q&\E&&]`, `[\Q&\E&&a]`, `[\Q&\E&&&a]` | behaves as literal content followed by intersection syntax; this is not the raw-ampersand malformed family |
| Escaped/quoted ampersand after scalar left expression | `[a\&\Q\E&&b]`, `[a\Q&\E&&b]`, `[ab\Q&\E&&b]`, `[a\Q&\E&&&b]` | follows literal-intersection behavior, which differs from raw `&` separator behavior |
| Escaped/quoted ampersand after nested/predefined left expression | `[[a]\&\Q\E&&]`, `[[a]\Q&\E&&]`, `[[a]\Q&\E&&a]`, `[\d\Q&\E&&\D]` | may reject empty trailing forms while accepting ordinary RHS intersections |
| Leading intersection edge forms | `[&&abc]`, `[ &&&]`, `[&&&a]`, `[&&&b]`, `[&&&&b]` | accepted forms match JDK membership; malformed leading `&&&b` and `&&&&b` are rejected |
| Unbracketed RHS terminator ampersand | `(?x)[a&&& [b]]` | the terminator `&` is not re-read as a literal and unioned with `[b]` |
| Negated variants | `[^[a]a-b&&]`, `(?x)[^[a]& &&]` | negation applies after completing the whole class expression |

Negation should apply to the completed class expression after the closing `]`,
not to whichever local parser fragment happened to be active when the `^` was
seen.  This matters for cases such as negated trailing intersections, where the
observable JDK membership is the complement of the whole parsed expression.

The exhaustive oracle probe for the current work found divergence clusters in
exactly these dimensions: raw `&` with zero-width syntax and no valid left
expression, raw `&` separator parity after established left expressions, quoted
`&` after nested/predefined/range operands, comments-mode trivia between raw
`&` and a following operator, and accidental rereading or dropping of raw
ampersands used as RHS terminators.  The design
therefore treats the product above as mandatory coverage, not as optional
regression examples.

An implementation should not claim this part of the design is complete merely
because the representative table passes.  Completion requires a generated
black-box matrix over the axes above either to agree with the JDK oracle for
compilation success/failure and representative membership or to classify each
remaining divergence under the documented unspecified-edge policy above.  Local
patches for individual spellings are not acceptable unless they fall out of the
same transition system.

The generated matrix is not part of the ordinary unit-test path.  Ordinary CI
should keep focused oracle-backed regression cases that cover known bug
families.  The full matrix should run only when an explicit long-running test
property is set, and it should support contiguous sharding and bounded local
debug runs.  Shards must be indexed directly into the generated product rather
than implemented as parameterized tests that re-enumerate and discard the rest
of the matrix.

The earlier token-state work was a staging step that fixed leading-intersection
and range-endpoint bugs without replacing the character-class subparser.  The
#273 expression-parser work completes that step by replacing local
intersection-only handling with an equivalent explicit state machine for the
JDK-observed character-class expression behavior.

The structural requirements are:

- Parse branches should name the JDK syntax family they implement.
- Dialect spellings from RE2, POSIX, Python, or PCRE should be accepted only
  when they are also JDK-compatible.
- Character-class parsing should have explicit handling for JDK intersection
  and subtraction edge cases, not a generic POSIX class interpretation.
- Character-class parser state should distinguish operator tokens, trivia,
  class items, first items, and range endpoints.
  The JDK docs describe character classes in terms of union, intersection,
  range, grouping, and operand classes; SafeRE uses "class item" as an internal
  parser-state term for a source-level unit that may consume first-item state.
  For example, a leading JDK intersection operator such as `&&` is syntax that
  changes the class expression, but it is not itself the first item.  After
  consuming such an operator, the next class item must still receive first-item
  semantics, including the JDK's treatment of leading `-`, `]`, and malformed
  repeated intersections.
- First-item privileges do not permit the generic range parser to reinterpret a
  leading literal as an arbitrary range.  The parser must validate each complete
  class item and, when parsing a range, must validate that both sides are valid
  scalar range endpoints.  For example, a nested class opener can begin a class
  item, but it cannot be consumed as an unescaped range endpoint.
- Escape parsing should separate "numeric backreference-like syntax,"
  "JDK octal syntax," and "invalid numeric escape" instead of treating them as
  one fallback.
- Error paths should throw `PatternSyntaxException` with stable enough messages
  for debugging, but tests should generally assert the exception type and
  index-sensitive behavior only when the public contract needs it.
- Unsupported-feature detection should be early and explicit so users get a
  clear rejection instead of a later malformed-AST failure.

The parser should not use the original source text after compilation to repair
syntax semantics.  Once parsed, the AST must represent the JDK-compatible
meaning or the pattern must have been rejected.

This also means SafeRE should not delegate parsing to the JDK as the primary
implementation strategy.  Delegation would not produce the SafeRE AST, would
not cleanly encode SafeRE's linear-time rejections, and would still leave the
compiler and engines responsible for the accepted semantics.  The JDK is the
test oracle, not the parser implementation.

## Test Strategy

Parser compatibility needs two kinds of tests.

### Compile/Error Tests

For every syntax family, tests should say whether JDK and SafeRE both accept
or reject a spelling.  Rejected non-regular JDK syntax is the main exception:
JDK may accept it, while SafeRE rejects it for the documented linear-time
reason.

Compile/error tests should include:

- representative ordinary forms;
- malformed forms adjacent to valid ones;
- dialect spellings that are tempting because RE2 or another regex engine
  accepts them;
- flag-sensitive forms;
- forms inside and outside character classes.

### Membership Tests

Accepted syntax must also be tested for meaning.  Compile parity alone would
not have caught #216 or #220.

Membership tests should:

- compare SafeRE and JDK on representative positive and negative inputs;
- include edge characters for class syntax, such as `&`, `[`, `]`, `:`, `^`,
  `-`, and representative range endpoints;
- distinguish operator tokens and trivia from the first item, including cases
  such as leading intersections followed by `-`, another `&&`, a solitary `&`,
  comments-mode whitespace, or the end of the class;
- distinguish class items from range endpoints, including malformed ranges that
  try to use a nested class opener as an endpoint and accepted neighboring
  forms where the same source character begins a nested class item;
- test nested and combined character-class operations;
- include a focused differential suite for the character-class expression
  parser, covering repeated, trailing, and ambiguous intersections with
  nested classes, predefined classes, quoted literals, negation, and
  comments-mode trivia;
- include class-expression edge families that stress parser state rather than
  only spelling examples: scalar/range content before and after nested or
  predefined operands; empty quoted literals before and after comments-mode
  trivia; repeated `&&`; unbracketed intersection RHS expressions ending at
  `&` or `]`; and negated variants of those forms;
- keep the #273 expression-parser cases enabled so future changes run against
  oracle coverage rather than a disabled backlog;
- include escape boundary values such as octal overflow points;
- use generated small-alphabet membership checks for character-class grammar
  where hand-written examples are likely to miss cases.

Generated public API crosscheck remains useful, but parser dialect tests should
not rely on accidental future fuzzing to discover the matrix.  The suite should
intentionally cover each syntax family.

This is intentionally a test-backed compatibility contract, not a formal proof.
The success criterion is that known syntax families and newly discovered
divergences are machine-checked against the JDK oracle or explicitly documented
under the unspecified-edge policy above.  The design should avoid language that
implies the parser can be proven equivalent to all current and future JDK
behavior.

## Linear-Time Argument

Parser dialect compatibility does not weaken the matching-time guarantee.

The design either:

- parses a JDK-compatible regular construct into the existing linear execution
  model; or
- rejects constructs that would require non-linear matching semantics.

Adding membership tests for accepted syntax does not imply that SafeRE must
support every JDK feature.  The acceptance decision remains constrained by the
core linear-time contract.  When JDK accepts a non-regular feature, SafeRE's
compatible behavior is a clear `PatternSyntaxException`, not backtracking
emulation.

Parser work must still preserve stack safety.  Any new source or AST walk used
for syntax classification should be iterative or bounded by local token
structure, not recursive over user-controlled nesting.

## Acceptance Criteria

This design track is complete when:

- the parser dialect policy is documented as "JDK-compatible or rejected," with
  reviewed explicit exceptions for unspecified JDK edge behavior;
- the design explicitly states that this is not a formal proof of complete JDK
  parser equivalence;
- `JdkSyntaxCompatibilityTest` or an equivalent focused suite contains a
  syntax-family matrix matching the table above;
- every known RE2/POSIX/Python-only spelling that SafeRE might accidentally
  accept has an explicit accept/reject test;
- POSIX bracket fragments inside Java character classes are tested as ordinary
  JDK character-class text;
- named-capture tests prove `(?<name>...)` is accepted and `(?P<name>...)` is
  rejected;
- character-class intersection and subtraction tests include zero-width class
  syntax, empty RHS, and repeated-operator edge cases;
- the generated character-class expression sweep is available as a long-running
  exhaustive validation tool, supports direct contiguous generated-case ranges,
  and is documented in the testing guide;
- character-class item-state tests prove that leading operators do not consume
  first-item privileges for the following class item;
- character-class range tests prove that only valid scalar endpoints are
  accepted, while nested class openers remain valid when they begin a class item;
- the #273 JDK-accepted character-class expression-precedence gaps are fixed by
  a dedicated character-class expression parser or equivalent explicit state
  machine, with examples and oracle-backed tests by default, or documented
  unspecified-edge divergences where exact JDK behavior is not adopted;
- newly discovered parser divergences outside the implemented #273 grammar are
  tracked separately only after they are classified by the dialect matrix and
  backed by oracle tests or documented as intentional divergences;
- octal and numeric escape tests cover accepted JDK forms, rejected malformed
  forms, and boundary values;
- unsupported non-regular JDK features are rejected by clear tests tied to the
  linear-time rationale;
- generated public API crosscheck can run parser-compatible public tests unless
  a test documents why it is not comparable;
- any future parser bug can be classified by adding a row or case to the matrix,
  not by inventing a new dialect policy.

## Non-Goals

- Do not add SafeRE regex syntax extensions.
- Do not emulate backreferences, lookaround, or other non-regular JDK features.
- Do not make error message text the main compatibility target unless users
  observe it through a documented API guarantee.
- Do not preserve RE2/POSIX source compatibility when it conflicts with
  `java.util.regex`.
- Do not replace or delegate the top-level regex parser as part of this design.
